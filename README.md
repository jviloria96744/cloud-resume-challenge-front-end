# Cloud Resume Challenge

This website is the front-end portion of my [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). Besides some JavaScript to update the visitor count table and display the current count as described in [Step 7](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/instructions/#7-javascript) of the challenge, everything is written in HTML/CSS.
